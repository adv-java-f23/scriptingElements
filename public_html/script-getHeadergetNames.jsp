                    </header>
                    <h2>getHeader()</h2>
                    <p>The <code><b>getHeader()</b></code> method is used to retrieve the value of a specific HTTP header from the request object. The request object is an instance of the HttpServletRequest class, which represents an HTTP request made by a client to a web server. The <code><b>getHeader()</b></code> method takes a string parameter that specifies the name of the header whose value is to be retrieved. The method returns a string containing the value of the specified header or null if the header does not exist in the request.</p>

                    <h2>getHeaderNames()</h2>
                    <p>The <code><b>getHeaderNames()</b></code> method is used to retrieve the names of all the HTTP headers that are present in the request object. The request object is an instance of the HttpServletRequest class, which represents an HTTP request made by a client to a web server. The <code><b>getHeaderNames()</b></code> method returns a java.util.Enumeration object containing the names of all the headers in the request. This enumeration can be used to iterate through all the headers and retrieve their values using the getHeader() method.</p>

                    <h2>Syntax</h2>
                    <h3>getHeader Syntax</h3>
                    <p><code><b>String host = request.getHeader("host");</b></code></p>

                    <h3>getHeaderNames Syntax</h3>
                    <p><code><b>Enumeration<String> headerNames = request.getHeaderNames();</b></code></p>

                    <h2>Examples</h2>
                    <p>Obtaining all the HTTP request header names and outputing them to the page in a table.</p>
                    <table>
                    <%
                        Enumeration headerNames = request.getHeaderNames();
                        while(headerNames.hasMoreElements()) {
                            String headerName = (String) headerNames.nextElement();
                    %>
                    <tr>
                        <td> <%= headerName %> </td>
                        <td> <%= request.getHeader(headerName) %></td>
                    </tr>
                    <%
                        }
                    %>
                    </table>
                    <p></p>

                    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Always check if the returned value is null: It's important to check if the header value returned by the getHeader() method is null before using it to avoid NullPointerExceptions.</li>
                        <li>Avoid hard-coding header names: Hard-coding header names in your code can make it difficult to maintain and update the code later. Instead, you can define constants to represent the header names.</li>
                        <li>Be mindful of the case sensitivity of header names: HTTP header names are case-insensitive, but some web servers or clients may treat them as case-sensitive. So, it's a good practice to use the header names consistently and correctly in your code.</li>
                        <li>Don't assume that all headers are present: Not all headers are required in an HTTP request. Some headers may be missing, depending on the client or the server. So, it's important to check if a header exists before attempting to retrieve its value.</li>
                        <li>Don't rely on headers for security: HTTP headers can be easily modified or spoofed by attackers. Therefore, you should not rely solely on headers for implementing security measures in your application.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Performance overhead: Retrieving headers from an HTTP request can incur some performance overhead, especially when dealing with large or complex requests. Repeatedly calling these methods to retrieve multiple headers can also add up to the processing time.</li>
                        <li>Security risks: HTTP headers can be easily manipulated or spoofed by attackers, leading to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, relying solely on headers for implementing security measures can be risky.</li>
                        <li>Case-sensitivity issues: While HTTP header names are case-insensitive, some web servers or clients may treat them as case-sensitive. Therefore, it's important to use header names consistently and correctly in your code.</li>
                        <li>Null values: The getHeader() method returns a null value if the specified header is not present in the request. Therefore, it's important to check for null values before using the header value in your code to avoid NullPointerExceptions.</li>
                        <li>Maintenance issues: Hard-coding header names in your code can make it difficult to maintain and update the code later. Changing header names or adding new headers to the code can require a lot of effort and testing.</li>
                        <li>Compatibility issues: The behavior of the getHeader() and getHeaderNames() methods may vary across different versions of the Servlet API or different web containers. Therefore, it's important to test your code on different platforms and versions to ensure compatibility.</li>
