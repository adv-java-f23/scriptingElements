                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>In Java, the <code><b>getQueryString()</b></code> method is a part of the HttpServletRequest interface, which is used to retrieve the query string of an HTTP request made by a client to a web server.</p>
                    <p>The query string is a part of the URL that follows the <code><b>?</b></code> character and contains key-value pairs separated by <code><b>&</b></code> symbols. It is commonly used to pass data between the client and the server, such as search parameters or form data.</p>
                    <p>The <code><b>getQueryString()</b></code> method returns a string containing the query string of the HTTP request or null if the request does not contain a query string.</p>

                    <h2>Syntax</h2>
                    <p><code><b>String queryString = request.getQueryString();</b></code></p>

                    
                    <h2>Examples</h2>
                    <p>
                    <%
                        String queryString = request.getQueryString();
                    %>
                    
                    <%=queryString%>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check for null values: The getQueryString() method returns null if the request does not contain a query string. Therefore, it's important to check for null values before using the query string in your code to avoid NullPointerExceptions.</li>
                        <li>Validate and sanitize the query string: The query string can contain user-supplied data, which can be vulnerable to injection attacks or other security risks. Therefore, it's important to validate and sanitize the query string before using it in your application.</li>
                        <li>Avoid using the query string for sensitive data: The query string is part of the URL and can be easily visible and tampered with by users or attackers. Therefore, it's not recommended to use the query string for sensitive data, such as passwords or personal information.</li>
                        <li>Use query parameters instead of hard-coding: Instead of hard-coding query string parameters in your code, you can use query parameters in the URL to make your code more flexible and reusable.</li>
                        <li>Be mindful of URL encoding: Query string parameters may contain special characters that need to be properly encoded to be included in the URL. Therefore, it's important to be mindful of URL encoding rules when working with query strings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Security risks: The query string can contain user-supplied data, which can be vulnerable to injection attacks or other security risks. Therefore, it's important to validate and sanitize the query string before using it in your application.</li>
                        <li>Limited data storage: The query string has a limited capacity for storing data, typically up to a few thousand characters. Therefore, it's not recommended to use the query string for large or complex data.</li>
                        <li>URL length restrictions: URLs have a maximum length limit that can vary across different web servers and clients. Therefore, using a long query string can lead to URL length restrictions or other compatibility issues.</li>
                        <li>Poor performance: The getQueryString() method can have a performance impact, especially when processing large or complex requests. Repeatedly calling this method to retrieve the query string can add up to the processing time.</li>
                        <li>Dependency on client behavior: The presence and format of the query string are dependent on the client's behavior, which can vary across different browsers or clients. Therefore, it's important to test your code on different platforms and versions to ensure compatibility.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
